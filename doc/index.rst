DataMapPlot: Creating beautiful plot of data maps
=================================================

Creating beautiful plots of data maps. DataMapPlot is a small library designed to help you make beautiful data map
plots for inclusion in presentations, posters and papers. The focus is on producing static plots,
or simple interactive plots, that are great looking with as little work for you as possible. All you need to do is
label clusters of points in the data map and DataMapPlot will take care of the rest. While this involves automating
most of the aesthetic choices, the library provides a wide variety of ways to customize the resulting
plot to your needs.
